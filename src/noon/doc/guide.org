* Noon

Noon is a clojure library that helps with *musical composition and exploration*.
It provides a way to compose, play and export music as *MIDI*.

The initial goal was to be able to define musical fragments in a very declarative way.
Leveraging clojure and functional programming powers in order to *generate, manipulate and organize* musical content.

** Motivation

Firstly, I was somewhat frustrated by the experience of computer-assisted music composition.
The tools commonly used for this, called digital audio workstations (DAWs), which include for example Logic Audio or Cubase, are certainly powerful, but quite laborious in use in my opinion.
The feedback loop seems a bit long to me. Changes are repetitive and quite slow, we spend a lot of time clicking, drag and dropping, and little time actually listening.

On the other hand, having primarily studied jazz, I would have liked to find the same kind of approach when composing with a computer.
In jazz (or other non classical music genres), a composition often consists of a melody and a chord grid. Its realization is largely left to the musician who interprets it.
This allows a composition to be relatively different from one version to another, compared to a piece composed in MIDI in a digital audio workstation which is quite rigid.

The improvisation and interpretation techniques used by musicians can be partially emulated by a computer.
Of course, what makes the essence of a very beautiful improvisation or interpretation will probably never be artificially reproduced, nevertheless it would be interesting to see how far we can go. Certain musical contexts and techniques require great speed of execution or calculation, and for that the machine is unbeatable.

Trying to use already existing musical libraries, I felt that this level of abstraction was not accessible to a degree that suits my needs.
- The [[https://github.com/overtone/overtone][overtone library]] is focusing mainly on sound synthesis, but not much on high level musical abstraction.
- The [[https://github.com/daveyarwood/alda-clj][alda library]] is low level, close to the MIDI representation in terms of abstraction level.
- The [[https://github.com/ctford/leipzig][leipzig library]] is aiming in this direction but I think we can go even further.

To sum up a bit, we could say that the level of musical abstraction currently in force in digital audio workstations is quite low.
In contrast to the level of abstraction generally used by musicians to think about music.
A level of abstraction that is too low will require a lot of work to realize ideas that are thought of quickly, and this leads to the relative slowness of the feedback cycle.

One of the objectives of this language will therefore be to allow the user to manipulate higher level musical abstractions, such as for example:
- a modulation
- a melodic contour
- a melodic or harmonic, diatonic or chromatic approach or embellishment.
- voice leading
- an inversion of a chord or melody.
The kind of ideas that musicians use to talk about music in a more concise and above all more general way.

** Elements

*** Building blocks

**** Events

An event is the basic building block we are dealing with.

It can represent any MIDI event, a note, a control change etc...

It is represented using a clojure map

#+begin_src clojure :pp
events/DEFAULT_EVENT
#+end_src

**** Score

A score is a collection of events, represented using a clojure set.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk) ; the `mk` function is used to build score, more on it later
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
#{{:position 0,
   :channel 0,
   :track 0,
   :duration 1,
   :pitch
   {:scale [0 2 4 5 7 9 11],
    :structure [0 2 4],
    :origin {:d 35, :c 60},
    :position {:t 0, :s 0, :d 0, :c 0}},
   :velocity 80,
   :voice 0,
   :patch [0 4]}}

#+end_src

*** Top form

=noon.output/noon= is the top level form of the library.

#+begin_src clojure
'(noon <option-map> <score>)
#+end_src

Here a minimal example:

#+begin_src clojure :results silent
(noon
 ;; the play option let you play the given score
 {:play true}
 ;; calling mk without argument just build the default score (middle C)
 (mk))
#+end_src

**** Options

The option map let you stay what you want to do with your score.

- =:midi true=
  Write the score as MIDI file.
  Default to false.

- =:bpm <number>=
  Set the tempo to <number> beats per minute.
  Default value is 60.

- =:play true=
  Play the score.
  Default to false.

- =:filename <path>=
  Setting the name and location of emitted files.
  File extensions will be appended to this filename.

- =:tracks {<track-idx> <sequencer> ...}=
  Set each track idxs to a =javax.sound.midi.Sequencer=
  This library comes with 4 nice soundfonts that sounds way better than builtin one (=:default=):
  1. =:squid=
  2. =:chorium=
  3. =:fluid=
  4. =:airfont=

example:

#+begin_src clojure
(noon {:play true
       :tracks {0 :chorium}} ;; try to change soundfont here

      ;; this will be explained later
      ;; it repeats an ascending scale with different patches
      ;; in order to demonstrate the soundfont
      (mk dur2
          (rup 8 d1)
          (lin (patch :clarinet)
               (patch :electric-piano-1)
               (patch :trumpet)
               (patch :ocarina))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {:source-file "generated/1733903842560.noon", :seed-file "generated/1733903842560.seed"}

In addition to those soundfonts, you can send the output of noon to any output device available on your machine.

#+begin_src clojure
(require 'noon.midi)
;; retrieve a device by name
(def bus1 (noon.midi/get-output-device "Bus 1"))
;; build a sequencer from it
(def bus1-sequencer (noon.midi/init-device-sequencer bus1))
;; use it to play a score
(noon {:play true
       :tracks {0 bus1-sequencer}}
      (mk (par s0 s1 s2)))
#+end_src

***** Musescore options

If you have [[https://musescore.org/en][musecore]] installed on your machine, you can emit music XML and pdf score.

- =:xml true=
  write the score as musicXML file.

- =:pdf true=
  write the score pdf file.

***** mp3 export

It is possible to create an mp3 file by passing this option:

=:mp3 true=

#+begin_src clojure :export-audio t
(noon {:mp3 true}
      (mk (tup s0 s1 s2)))
#+end_src

[[https://ffmpeg.org/][FFmpeg]] and [[https://www.fluidsynth.org/][FluidSynth]] have to be installed on your machine.

**** score

As we've just seen, we can create a score with the =mk= function.
With no arguments it simply returns the default score containing only a middle C.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src clojure
#{{:position 0,
   :duration 1,
   :channel 0,
   :track 0,
   :velocity 80,
   :pitch
   {:scale [0 2 4 5 7 9 11],
    :structure [0 2 4],
    :origin {:d 35, :c 60},
    :position {:t 0, :s 0, :d 0, :c 0}},
   :voice 0,
   :patch [0 4]}}
#+end_src

The =mk= function can take any number of arguments, each one being a score transformation.

Those transformations are applied in order to the default score.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
'(mk transformation1 transformation2 ...)
#+end_src

**** shorthands

As a convenience, some thin =noon.output/noon= wrappers are defined:

***** =noon.output/play=

#+begin_src clojure
'(play transformation1 transformation2 ...)
#+end_src

Which is is roughly equivalent to:

#+begin_src clojure
'(noon {:play true}
       (mk transformation1 transformation2 ...))
#+end_src

More concretly:

#+begin_src clojure
(play dur2
      (tup s0 s1 s2 s3))
#+end_src

***** =noon.output/write=

TODO
*** Transformations 1

There is a bunch of transformations available, let's see the basics.

**** Pitches

We can set the current pitch by using pitch vars.

Pitch vars names consist of a pitch-class name followed by an octave offset.
(pitch classes are simply musical notes names like C, Db, F#, E, Bbb, Fx (x mean double sharp)).
The middle C is named C0, the C above is C1, the C below is C-1.

Here some examples of pitches:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play Eb0)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play F#-1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play Gb2)
#+end_src

Pitches are not often used as is, we will prefer more relative constructs like intervals, patterns etc...
But it may be a little overwhelming to start with, so for now we will use them to introduce the basics building blocks of the system.

**** Durations

We can operate on durations by multiplying or dividing them.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur2) ; multiplies the duration of our middle C by 2
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:3) ; divides it by 3
#+end_src

There is also a more flexible (and verbose) way to build duration transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(dur 2) ; sets the duration to 2
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(dur 1/4) ; sets the duration to 1/4
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(dur (fn [x] (* x 2))) ; multiply by 2 the current duration.
#+end_src

Those 3 forms return a transformation that can be used in =mk= or =play=

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (dur 1/4))
#+end_src

**** Velocities

Velocity is the force with which a note is played, and it is vitally important in making MIDI performances sound human.

In midi the velocity is a number between 0 and 127.

For easing notation, 12 levels of velocity are defined as vars.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play vel0) ; silent
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play vel3) ; piano
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play vel8) ; forte
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play vel12) ; fortissimo
#+end_src

Like for duration there is also a more flexible form:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (vel 100)) ; sets the midi velocity of the current event to 100 (forte).
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (vel (fn [x] (/ x 2)))) ; divide the current velocity by 2 (by default the velocity is 80)
#+end_src

**** Composition

We can compose any number of transformations together using a clojure vector.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play [Eb0 dur:2]) ; plays a Eb of half duration
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play [F#-1 dur4 (vel 127)]) ; F# above the middle C with quadruple duration and max velocity.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play [(vel 127) dur4 F#-1]) ; the order do not matter in this case.
#+end_src

The =noon.output/play= and the =noon.score/mk= functions, when given several arguments are doing exactly this

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play F#-1 dur4) ; is the same as (play [F#-1 dur4])
#+end_src

**** Concatenation

Using the =lin= function we can create our first melody.
The =lin= function takes an arbitrary number of transformations and concatenate their results into one score.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin C0 E0 G0 B0))
#+end_src

=lin= accept any valid transformation, here we are using composite transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin [C0 dur:2]
           [Eb0 dur:4]
           [G0 dur:4]
           C1))
#+end_src

**** Superposition

Using the =par= function we can stack things up.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par C0 Eb0 G0)) ; a C minor chord.
#+end_src

A pianissimo, double duration, Csus4 chord:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play vel2
      dur2
      (par C0 F0 G0))
#+end_src

**** Sounds

By default, we are using general MIDI to emit sounds, it is not the most exciting way to play MIDI but it is everywhere and gives you a rapid feedback without extra setup.

Of course if you want to use fancy VSTs in a proper DAW you can, one of the feature of this library is to export MIDI files after all.

Here how you can leverage general MIDI sounds:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :clarinet) (lin C0 E0 G#0 B0))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) [dur:4 (lin C0 E0 G0 (par D1 B0))])
#+end_src

You can look at what is available here

#+begin_src clojure :pp
noon.vst.general-midi/summary
#+end_src

**** Channels

In most of the tunes we write, we want several instruments playing together.

In MIDI there is this concept of channel, it serve the purpose to separate different streams of events.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (chans
  [(patch :ocarina) dur:2 (lin G0 Eb0 C0 G-1 F0 D0 A-1 F-1)]
  [(patch :vibraphone) dur2 vel3 (lin (par C0 Eb0 G0) (par A-1 F0 D0))]
  [(patch :acoustic-bass) (lin [dur3 C-2] G-2)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

*** Transformations 2

**** Intervals 1

It is now time to brings intervals into the equation, pitches were nice for introduction purposes but lacks the flexibility that intervals have. When musicians think about music, they do not think in precise pitches most of the time, they more often thinks of scales, intervals, degrees, melodic contour etc... Those higher level abstractions are available in this system and in fact it is the whole point of it. Some really nice libraries already exists to deal with low levels aspects of music notation and sound synthesis.

In noon there is two types of intervals: *steps* and *shifts*.

***** Steps

Steps are the most commonly used type of interval.

The 2 most common types of steps are chromatic steps and diatonic steps

****** Chromatic

A chromatic step is a movement by semitones.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(c-step 3) ; going up 3 semitones from wherever we are.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure
(c-step -1) ; going down one semitone
#+end_src

Those kind of transformation are so common that they are available as vars:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
c1 ; equivalent to (c-step 1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
c2- ; equivalent to (c-step -2)
#+end_src

All chromatic steps from =c36= to =c36-= are available.

If we apply the =c3= step to the default score, it transpose the default middle C (=C0=) 3 semitones up to =Eb0= (or =D#0=).

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play c3)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (c-step -3)) ; going down 3 semitones to A-1
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play c12-) ; going 12 semitones down (one octave) to C-1
#+end_src

****** Diatonic

A diatonic step is a movement toward a note that belong to the current scale.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(d-step 1) ; move to the upper scale note (or degree).
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(d-step -1) ; moves to the above scale note (or degree).
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(d-step 4) ; moves four scale degree up...
#+end_src

Those kind of transformation are so common that they are available as vars:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
d1 ; is equivalent to (d-step 1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
d2- ; is equivalent to (d-step -2)
#+end_src

all diatonic steps from =d21= to =d21-= are available.

******* Example

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (lin d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7)) ; ascending scale
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (lin d0 d2 d1 d3 d2 d4 d3 d5 d4)) ; broken scale pattern
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (lin d0 d2- d1- d3- d2- d4- d3- d5- d4-)) ; same downward
#+end_src

By default, we are in the C major scale, but of course it can be changed. (see [[*Harmony][Harmony]] section)

As a quick example, pretty self explanatory (but explained in more details later).

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (root :Eb) (scale :hungarian) (lin d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7))
#+end_src

There is 2 more type of steps: *structural* and *tonic*, but we will see them later.

***** Octaves

Paraphrasing wiki:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In music, an octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as *the basic miracle of music*. The interval between the first and second harmonics of the harmonic series is an octave.
#+END_QUOTE

In noon, octaves are a different kind of interval, they belong to the =shift= family.

The nuance will appear more clearly later... Until then, let see how to use them:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-shift 1)) ; one octave up.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-shift -1)) ; one octave down.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play o2-) ; 2 octaves down in var notation
#+end_src

**** lin

As we have seen, =lin= let you create a succession of events:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin C0 E0 G0 B0))
#+end_src

Let's try to go further with it by composing it with another =lin=:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:8 (lin c0 c3 c6) (lin c0 c2 c3 c5))
#+end_src

Let see what happens here:

3 transformations are chained:

1. We are dividing the duration of our base note by 8.
2. We are creating a series of 3 notes using chromatic intervals (diminished triad C,Eb,Gb).
3. Then this 3 notes score is passed to each member of the second =lin= expression, each one transposing it from the indicated chromatic interval.

**** tup

=tup= stands for tuplet and is analogous to =lin= but keep the duration of the given score unchanged.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8))
#+end_src

The resulting notes are fitted into the duration of the base note.

Like =lin= it can of course be chained with other transformations, as an example, here is a classic jazz melodic pattern.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup c0 c2 c4 c7) (tup c0 c3) (rep 3 c4-))
#+end_src

**** dup

=dup= stands for duplicate and let you repeat a score n times.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup c0 c3 c6 c9) (dup 3))
#+end_src

**** rep

=rep= let you apply a transformation several times in a row accumulating intermediate results.

A melody of 8 successive major thirds (4 semitones):

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (rep 8 c4))
#+end_src

Be careful, with more complex transformations it can quickly become hairy:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rep 6 (tup c5 c10)))
#+end_src

You can remove the input score at the start of the result by giving an extra argument:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rep 3 o1 :skip-first))
#+end_src

**** fit

=fit= is used to make a transformation fit the current duration of the score.
The 2 previous transformations introduced: =dup= and =rep=, are changing the score duration, but sometimes we want to transform our score in place, stretching or compressing it, in the same way =tup= is acting.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup c0 c4) (fit (rep 4 c2)))
#+end_src

In fact =tup= is just a composition of =fit= and =lin=.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(= (mk (tup c0 c3 c8)) (mk (fit (lin c0 c3 c8))))
#+end_src

The composition of =fit= and =rep= is also defined as =rup= for lack of a better name:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rup 15 d1))
#+end_src

A fitted version of =dup= also exists under the name =dupt=

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup d0 d3 d6 d7) (dupt 3))
#+end_src

**** nlin

concat the results of the given transformation n times

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (nlin 4 (tup d0 d1 d2 d3)))
#+end_src

it is the same thing as:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup d0 d1 d2 d3) (dup 4))
#+end_src

**** ntup

the fitted version of =nlin=

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (ntup 4 (tup d0 d1 d2 d3)))
#+end_src

**** lin>

=lin>= stands for accumulative concatenation, it accumulates the given transformations concatenating the intermediate results.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin> c0 c2 c2 c2 c2 c2 c2))
#+end_src

**** tup>

=tup>= is doing the same as =lin>=, except it maintains the score original duration.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup> d0 d1 d1 d1 d1 d1 d1 d1))
#+end_src

*** Polyphony

As we have seen, we can parallelize things with the =par= function.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par c0 c3 c7 c9 c14)) ; a Cm69 chord.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par c10 c0 c16 c5)) ; a C7sus4add10 using set literal
#+end_src

But we are not limited to use simple intervals, we can use any score transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :electric-piano-1)
 (par (tup d0 d2 d4 o1)
      [vel3 (par> o1 d4) (fit (rep 8 d1))]
      o1-))
#+end_src

Parallels transformations can be used anywhere of course. Here inside a =tup=.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play o1
      (tup c0 (par c15 c10)
           c9 (par c6 c4))
      (rep 3 c3))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par (rep 12 c1)
           (rep 12 c1-)))
#+end_src

Like =lin= and =tup=, =par= has its accumulative counterpart:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par> d0 d2 d2 d2 d2)) ; piling diatonic thirds.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :string-ensemble-1)
      o2-
      (par> c0 c7 c7 c7 c7 c7)) ; piling perfect fifths.
#+end_src

**** Channels

the =chans= function is doing the same thing as =par= except that it put each element on a separate MIDI channel.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (chans c0 c3 c7))
#+end_src

To be more precise it put each of its argument on subsequent midi channels starting at the current one. By default, we are on channel 0, so here the C will stay on channel 0, the Eb will go on channel 1 and the G on channel 2.

When we want more fine control we can use the =chan= function, that works like =vel= and =dur=

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(chan 1) ; set midi channel to 1
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(chan 3) ; set midi channel to 3
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(chan inc) ; increment the current midi channel.
#+end_src

We can achieve the same thing as the first expression of the section using =par= and =chan= like this:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (par [(chan 0) c0]
           [(chan 1) c3]
           [(chan 2) c7]))
#+end_src

**** Tracks

Tracks are a way of not be limited to only 16 channels, you can create virtually as many as you want. Most of the time, 16 channels are enough but who knows... The =tracks= function works exactly like the =chans= function, except that it operates on the =:track= entry of events.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :flute)
 (tracks (tup> c0 c5 c5 c5- c2- c7-)
         (tup> c0 c2- c5 c5))
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

By default we are on track 0. So the second argument of tracks goes on track 1. Like with channels we can be more precise by using the =track= function.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(track 1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(track 12)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(track (fn [x] (+ x 3)))
#+end_src

*** Mapping

All the transformations we've seen so far are acting on a score to produce another score, but sometimes what we need is to apply a transformation on each event of a score, for this we are using the =each= function.

As an illustration, here those two fragments:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin c0 c1 c2 c3)
      (tup c0 o1)) ; each member of this `tup` form receives and operate on the whole score
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin c0 c1 c2 c3)
      (each (tup c0 o1))) ; each event of the score is transformed using this `tup` transformation.
#+end_src

One important thing to be aware of is that events will be mapped in place, so if the given transformation expand the score, some superposition will occur.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin c0 o1)
      (each [dur:4 (rep 8 c1-)]))
#+end_src

Some others functions exists to transform only subparts of the score, if interested you can look at =$by= and/or =parts=.

*** Dynamism

For now our scores are pretty static, and don't use the power of clojure much. Since this library is built out of simple functions it should be a easy to do so.

There is a bunch of things to know in order to ease things.

**** Star functions

Variadic functions have a 'star' counterpart that accepts a sequence instead of variadic args.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(tup c1 c2 c3)
#+end_src

Is similar to:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(tup* [c1 c2 c3])
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(tup* (list c1 c2 c3))
#+end_src

It ease things a bit when using clojure to generate arguments of those functions. Avoiding to write =apply= everywhere.

**** Map functions

maps can be used to compose event transformations

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play {:velocity (fn [x] (/ x 2)), :duration (fn [x] (* x 2))})
#+end_src

**** Examples

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup* (shuffle [c0 c3 c7 c9])))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :electric-piano-1)
 (tup* (map (fn [v] {:velocity v}) (range 0 127 15))))
#+end_src

*** Non determinism

It is quite fun to insert a bit of randomness in our scores.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (rand-nth [(tup c0 c4 c7) (tup c0 c3 c7)])
 (rep 4 (rand-nth [c3 c4 c3- c4-])))
#+end_src

We can use some great available tools like =test.check.generators= to handle non determinism. That being said, some commonly used non-deterministic functions are available directly.

**** one-of

=one-of= picks randomly one of the given transformations and apply it.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (one-of o1- o1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:8 (rep 50 (one-of c1 c1-)))
#+end_src

**** maybe

=maybe= is very similar to =one-of= except it has a chance to do nothing (identity transformation).

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (maybe o1 o2)) ; may do nothing, or one octave up, or two octave up
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (one-of same o1 o2)) ; the equivalent `one-of` form
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:8 (rep 50 (maybe c1 c1-))) ; you can notice melodic repetitions unlike with the corresponding one-of example.
#+end_src

**** probs

=probs= gives you more control over the probability of occurence of the given transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (probs {o1 4, o1- 1})) ; 4/5 to go up one octave, 1/5 chance to go down one octave
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:4 (rep 24 (probs {c1 6, c6- 1, (par c0 o1-) 1})))
#+end_src

**** any-that

=any-that= is similar to =one-of= except it takes an extra first argument that check if the picked transformation is valid.

A melody of 60 notes using the 6 given intervals but remaining in the given pitch bounds:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur:8
      (rep 60
           (any-that (within-pitch-bounds? :C-1 :C1)
                     c2 c5 c7 c2- c5- c7-)))
#+end_src

The =within-pitch-bounds?= is just a score transformation that return the score unchanged if it is within the given bounds, else it returns =nil=. Any function of this kind can be used has first argument to =any-that=.

**** !

the =!= macro can be useful to deal with raw non deterministic expressions. here the docstring:

#+begin_quote
Takes a non deterministic expression resulting in a score transformation. return a score transformation that wraps the expression so that it is evaluated each time the transformation is used.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (nlin 4 (! (tup* (shuffle [d0 d2 d4 d6])))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (nlin 4 (tup* (shuffle [d0 d2 d4 d6])))) ; without the bang the shuffle expression is executed only one time.
#+end_src

**** Shuffling

As in the previews example, building a =tup= or a =lin= with shuffled sequence of transformation is quite fun.

So two shortcuts are defined:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (shuftup d0 d2 d4 d6))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (shuflin d0 d2 d4 d6))
#+end_src

*** Harmony

It is time to enter more deeply into the harmonic system. In this part we will see how to deal with scales, modes, chords, modulations and more...

**** Intervals 2

So far we've seen 3 types of intervals, chromatic steps, diatonic steps and octaves (aka tonic shifts). Let see the two remaining kinds of steps.

***** Steps

****** Structural

Most of the time, our music is based on chords.

Structural steps are targeting chord notes. By default the harmony is set to C Major scale, and C Major chord (C major triad).

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (s-step 1)) ; ascending third
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (s-step 2)) ; ascending fifth
#+end_src

As other steps, corresponding vars are defined:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play s1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play s2)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play s1-)
#+end_src

******* Examples

******** Arpegios

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rup 6 s1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rep 4 s1-) (each (tup> s2 s2 s2 s1- s2- s1-)))
#+end_src

******** Passing tones

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (scale :eolian) dur:2 o2 (rep 12 s1-) (each (tup s0 c1- d1 s0)))
#+end_src

****** Tonic

The last kind of step is the tonic one.

It let you jump to the root of the tonality.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-step 1)) ; upper tonic
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-step -1)) ; above tonic
#+end_src

As other steps corresponding vars are defined:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play t1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play t2)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play t1-)
#+end_src

******* Examples

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rup 4 t1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (rep 3 t1) (each (tup> s0 s1 s1 d1-)))
#+end_src

**** Implementation

Those four types of steps can be seen as belonging to 4 successive layers build on each others.

1. chromatic: =[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]=
  the chromatic layer, 12 successive semitones
2. diatonic: =[0 2 4 5 7 9 11]=
  we select indexes from the above layer (chromatic) to form the diatonic layer (here the major scale)
3. structural: =[0 2 4]=
  same here but based on the diatonic layer to form the structural layer (here the basic triad)
4. tonic: =[0]=
  the root

As you see, the chromatic layers and tonic layers are trivial, so they are omitted in the harmonic context representation.

The harmonic context can be found under the :pitch key of any event.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(=
 (:pitch events/DEFAULT_EVENT)
 {:scale [0 2 4 5 7 9 11],
  :structure [0 2 4],
  :origin {:d 35, :c 60},
  :position {:t 0, :s 0, :d 0, :c 0}})
#+end_src

The :origin key hold the pitch from where our layers starts (in both directions).

The :position key holds a map with the 4 layers indexes

#+begin_src clojure :pp
:t ; tonic
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
:s ; structural
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
:d ; diatonic
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
:c ; chromatic
#+end_src

**** Shifts

At least we will understand the nuance between steps and shifts. To do so let's compare tonic steps and tonic shifts (aka octaves).

At first glance they seems to be equivalent:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-shift 1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (t-step 1))
#+end_src

In this case they are indeed equivalent, in each case a C1 is played. But how about this ?

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play s1 (t-shift 1)) ; plays a E1
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play s1 (t-step 1)) ; plays a C1
#+end_src

In the first expression (the shift) we have transposed the score (a E0 note) by 1 tonic layer index. In the second one (the step) we have stepped to the next tonic layer index.

In practice, apart for octaves, shifts are not used so often, thats the reason why they don't have defined vars as steps have. They are mainly used in more complex harmonic operations (voice leading etc...).

**** Tonality

***** scale

By default the major scale is used, but it can be changed. Most of the known scales and modes are available via the =scale= function or directly by name.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
noon.constants/modes ; modes full list
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (scale :dorian) dur:4 (rep 8 d1)) ; dorian scale
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk harmonic-minor) ; sets scale to harmonic-minor
#+end_src

***** structure

By default we use the triad structure (tonic, third, fifth), but it can be changed. Some common structures are predefined and available by name.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
noon.constants/structures ; full structure list
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (structure :tetrad)) ; sets structure to tetrad
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk sus47) ; set-structure-to-sus47
#+end_src

***** origin

The last thing we need to setup an harmonic context is an origin pitch.

By default the origin is setup to middle C.

We can use the =origin= function to change this

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (origin :Eb0))
#+end_src

****** Examples

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (lin (origin :C0) (origin :E0) (origin :G#0)) (each (rup 6 s1)))
#+end_src

***** root

The root update works a bit like =origin= but it takes a pitch-class instead of a pitch. It moves the :origin of the harmonic context to the closest pitch matching the given pitch class.

For instance if the origin is on =C0=, =(root :B)= will put the origin on =B-1= because =B-1= is closer to =C0= than =B0=.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (root :D))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (root :B))
#+end_src

****** Examples

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (lin* (map root [:C :E :G#]))
 (each (chans (par d0 d3 d6 d9) [(rup 4 d3) (rup 3 d2)]))
 (rep 4 s1))
#+end_src

***** transpose

the transpose update takes an interval or a position and use it to update the origin of the harmonic context

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (scale :lydianb7) (rup 6 d2) (rep 4 (transpose c3-)))
#+end_src

***** rebase

Sometimes when changing the harmonic context, we want to stay on the same pitch, the =rebase= function let you do that.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (rebase (root :E)))
#+end_src

Here we are modulating to E major, but we are staying on the pitch we were on (=C0=).

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(=
 (get-in (mk (rebase (root :E))) [:pitch :position])
 {:t 0, :s -1, :d 0, :c 1})
#+end_src

This position points to =C0= but in the context of E major.

The =rebase= function can take several harmonic context transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (rebase (root :E) (scale :mixolydianb6)))
#+end_src

***** degree

Move to the nth degree of the current scale (mode), negative indexes are allowed.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (degree 2)) ; move to the 3rd degree of C major, E phrygian
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(mk (scale :melodic-minor) (degree -1)) ; move to the 7th degree of C melodic minor, B superlocrian.
#+end_src

Roman numeral vars are also available to change degree.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :trumpet) (lin I IV V I) (each (tup s0 s1 s2)))
#+end_src

** Composing

When composing music, 4 major aspects are considered: melody, rythmn, harmony and tone. In this section some tools to deal with those aspects will be introduced.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(require
 '[noon.lib.harmony :as h]
 '[noon.lib.melody :as m]
 '[noon.lib.rythmn :as r]
 '[noon.utils.sequences :as seqs])
#+end_src

*** Melody

Let see some ways to deal with melodies.

**** Bounding

One of the most common things we want to be able to control when generating melodies is the range.

***** within-pitch-bounds?

This function returns nil if any event of the score is not in the given pitch bounds.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(= (mk Eb0 (within-pitch-bounds? :C-1 :C0)) nil)
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(= (mk Eb0 (within-pitch-bounds? :C0 :C1)) (mk Eb0))
#+end_src

This function is handy in conjuction with the =any-that= or =fst-that= forms.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :electric-piano-1)
 dur:8
 (rep 60 (any-that (within-pitch-bounds? :C0 :C1) c1 c1- c5 c5-)))
#+end_src

The =fst-that= form takes a test and any number of update that will be tried in order until one pass the test.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur:8
 (rep
  60
  (fst-that (within-pitch-bounds? :C0 :C1) (one-of c5 c5-) c2 c2-)))
#+end_src

Random melodies are nice at first but can quickly become boring. It is often more pleasing to develop one or more ideas gradually via simple transformations.

**** Rotations

Rotating a melody is a way to evolve it while preserving its identity.

***** Example

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (fit (rep 8 d1)) (m/rotation 3))
#+end_src

***** Forms

The =noon.lib.melody/rotation= accepts several types of argument:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation 2) ; rotate two notes forward
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation -3) ; rotate three notes backward
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation 1/2) ; rotate half the size forward
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation -1/3) ; rotate third the size backward
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation :rand) ; random rotation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/rotation [0 1/2]) ; random rotation between first and half the size
#+end_src

This kind of argument (that I will call a 'member-pick') will be used at many other places within this section, it came from the =noon.utils.sequences/member= function, here the docstring:

Find or pick an element within a sequence 's.
available forms:
- =(member s <integer>)= normal nth like get
- =(member s <negative-integer>)= nth from the end of the list
- =(member s <float-or-rational>)= a non integer between -1 and 1, is picking a member relatively to the length of the list, forward if positive, backward if negative.
- =(member s <[min max]>)= picks a member randomly between the given idxs (every type of index allowed)
- =(member s <:rand|:random>)= picks a random member

***** Chords

Not only pure melodies can be rotated, if we feed chords into the =rotation= transformation it behaves as intended.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (fit (rep 8 d1)) (each (par d0 d3 d6)) (m/rotation 1/4))
#+end_src

**** Permutations

Another way to transform a melody while preserving a bit of its identity is to permute it. But for long melody, a random permutation can make it so distant to the original that it miss the point. For this reason, permutations are ordered and requested by complexity (similarity degree with the original)

***** Forms

Like the rotation function, the =permutation= function uses a 'member-pick argument.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation 2) ; the second most similar permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation -1) ; the less similar permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation 1/2) ; half way between most similar and most different
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation -1/4) ; one quite distant permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation :rand) ; random permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation [1/4 -1/4]) ; a not too much similar nor different permutation
#+end_src

***** Example

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(let
 [space [vel0 dur:8]]
 (play
  (patch :electric-piano-1)
  (tup d0 d2 d1 d3 d2 d4 d3 d5)
  (lin
   same
   space
   (m/permutation 1)
   space
   (m/permutation 2)
   space
   (m/permutation -1/4))))
#+end_src

***** Options

****** Grade

The permutations are categorised by grade, the grade of a permutation correspond to the number of splits that has to be made on the original seq to obtain it. For instance a grade 1 permutation is one that we can obtain by splitting our original sequence in 2 parts.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(require '[noon.utils.sequences :as seqs])

(=
 (seqs/grade-permutations [0 1 2 3] 1)
 '((2 3 0 1) (1 2 3 0) (3 0 1 2)))
#+end_src

This way to categorise permutations can be helpful to have more control over the similarity of the resulting permutation. In addition to this the returned permutations for a given grade are ordered starting from the more balanced splits. As you can see in the previous example, (2 3 0 1) is the first permutation of grade 1, and contains 2 splits of size 2: (2 3) and (0 1).

We can leverage those grades via our =m/permutation= function like this:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation 0 {:grade 1}) ; get the first grade 1 permutation.
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(m/permutation -1 {:grade [1 3]}) ; get the last permutation for a randomly picked grade between 1 and 3.
#+end_src

****** Layers

As we've seen, our melodies are built on different harmonic layers (chromatic, diatonic, structural and tonic), the =m/permutation= function is letting you act on or inside a particular layer.

As an example for this, please consider this kind of melody.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur2 (tup s0 s1 s2 s3) (each (tup d1 d1- d0)))
#+end_src

We start with an ascension on the structural layer, then adding some diatonic ornementation on each structural degree. Those diatonic notes have meaning relatively to the structural degrees they are based upon. If we do a raw permutation on this melodic line we are losing those relations. With the :layer option we can permute only the structural layer keeping those diatonic ornementations untouched.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (tup s0 s1 s2 s3)
 (each (tup d1 d1- d0))
 (m/permutation 1 {:layer :s}))
#+end_src

****** Split sizes

TODO

**** Mixed example

In the following example you can get a sense of the effect of deriving a melody from simple transformations.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description
  "rand harmonic seq using IV II and VI degrees on vibraphone,
   ocarina melody derives using transposition, rotation and permutation."}
 (chans
  [(patch :vibraphone)
   vel3
   (ntup 4 [(one-of IV II VI) tetrad (par [t2- vel5] s0 s1 s2 s3)])]
  [(patch :ocarina)
   vel5
   (shuftup d1 d2 d3 d4 d5)
   (each (maybe (par d0 d3)))
   (rup
    16
    (probs
     {(m/permutation :rand) 1,
      (m/rotation :rand) 3,
      (one-of* (map d-step (range -3 4))) 5}))])
 (adjust 10)
 (append [d2- (transpose c3)] [d2 (transpose c3-)] same))
#+end_src

**** Contour

The idea of contour is quite simple. When you see a melody on a score or a pianoroll, by linking the successive notes you can make a line. This line has a certain shape, some melodies with different notes share the same shape (contour). The contour of a melody greatly participate to its identification by the listener. So by keeping a contour and changing the notes, we can ensure a kind of continuity in our melodic developments.

For instance those different melodies are all sharing the same contour: [0 2 1 2]

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s2 s1 s2))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s3 s2 s3))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup d0 d2 d1 d2))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup d1 d5 d2 d5))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s2 s4 d8 s4))
#+end_src

You can clearly hear the similarity between those

***** contour

:docstring

        changing the melodic contour of a score.

        forms:
        (contour :mirror <options>) : mirror the contour of the score.
        (contour :rotation <options>) : rotate the contour of the score.
        (contour :similar <options>) : get a different score with the same contour.

        <options>
        a map that may contain some of those keys:

        :layer : (all commands, default to score's lowest harmonic layer)
            The harmonic layer on which the contour transformation is performed

        :pick | :nth : (:rotation and :similar commands, default to :random)
            A 'member-pick (see `member function) to select one particular outcome.

        :extent : (:similar command only)
            A vector of min and max amount of deformation that we want to apply to the score.

        :delta : (:similar command only)
            The amount of shrinking or growing we want to apply to the score.

***** Demo

Let's take this simple arpegio to start

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2)) ; {:contour [0 1 2 3 1 2]}
#+end_src

Here the way to obtain the mirror contour of the previous arpegio.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :mirror)) ; {:contour [3 2 1 0 3 2]}
#+end_src

Next let's try contour rotations:

Here we are picking the first rotation (with the option =:nth=)

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :rotation {:nth 1})) ; {:contour [1 2 3 0 2 3]}
#+end_src

Every contour index has been shifted one step up, the highest one returning all the way down.

Lets get the last rotation using a 'member-pick argument.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :rotation {:pick -1})) ; {:contour [3 0 1 2 0 1]}
#+end_src

If no :pick or :nth option is given, select a random one.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :rotation))
#+end_src

One of the nice things with contours is that it can serve to generate many melodies. Using the =:similar= commands we can do this.

Here we are randomly picking a similar score that is one structural step wider (:delta 1) that the original one.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :similar {:delta 1}))
#+end_src

In all the previous exemples, the contour was computed over the structural layer. When the layer is not specified, the score's lowest harmonic layer is used, here the structural layer.

As an illustration let's look at the effect of specifying the layer within the :mirror contour operation:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :mirror)) ; Original example
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :mirror {:layer :d})) ; Mirrored diatonically, resulting in a F major arpegio
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2) (m/contour :mirror {:layer :c})) ; Mirror chromatically, resulting in a F minor arpegio (it can help with 'negative harmony')
#+end_src

One of the similar scores between those shrinked by 2 diatonic step and those expanded by 3 diatonic steps (:extent [-2 3] :layer :d).

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (tup s0 s1 s2 s3 s1 s2)
 (m/contour :similar {:extent [-2 3], :layer :d}))
#+end_src

**** Line

One simple way to build a melody is to concatenate some little fragments one after another, building the next fragment on the last note of the previous one.

There are several ways to do this:

#+begin_src clojure :proll

*** Rythmn

So far we havn't discuss rythmn so much, let see what we have at our disposal to deal with it.

**** Simple

As we've seen earlier, we can use the =duration= related transformations to write simple rythmns

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :woodblock)
 dur:4
 (lin same dur:2 dur:2 same dur2 same same))
#+end_src

This is not a pretty way to write it ! We can use the =_= shortcut instead of =same=, and the =tup= function for making this a bit more readable.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :woodblock) dur:4 (lin _ (tup _ _) _ dur2 _ _))
#+end_src

We can also use the =dupt= function if we prefer.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :woodblock) dur:4 (lin _ (dupt 2) _ dur2 _ _))
#+end_src

We could have done it like so too:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :woodblock) dur2 (tup* (map dur [1 1/2 1/2 1 2 1 1])))
#+end_src

There is a function to help writing a rythmn this way:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur2 (r/durtup 1 1/2 1/2 1 2 1 1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play dur2 (r/durtup* [1 1/2 1/2 1 2 1 1]))
#+end_src

Writing those kind of rythmns is not the funniest thing to do of course, let see how we can generate and transform rythmns.

**** Generation

The main tool we have at our disposal to create a rythmn is the noon.lib.melody/gen-tup

***** gen-tup

form:
       (gen-tup resolution size & options)

       Generates a rythmic tup based on the given arguments:
       resolution: the number of subdivisions that we will use.
       size: the number of notes that the generated tup will contain.
       options:
         euclidean: generates an euclydean tup.
         durations: the multiples of =resolution= that we are allowed to use (fractionals allowed).
         shifted: the possibility for the generated tup to not begin on beat.
         

***** Examples

randomly dispose 5 notes into 8 subdivisions.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 8 5) (dup 4))
#+end_src

Lets add a metronome

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 8 5)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

A bit slower

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- o1)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 16 8)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

Let's try 12/8

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- o1)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 12 6) (each (maybe o1 o1-))])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

Using the =:shifted= keyword you can give your tup a chance to not start on beat.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- o1)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 16 7 :shifted) (each (maybe o1 o1-))])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

You can specifies which durations are allowed with the =:durations= option

here we are generating a tuple of resolution 12 and size 5, using only 2/12 and 3/12 durations.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- o1)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 12 5 :durations [2 3])])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

A 3 voices example:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :tinkle-bell)
 dur2
 (par
  [o1- (dupt 2)]
  (r/gen-tup 12 5 :shifted :durations [1 2 3])
  [o1 (r/gen-tup 12 7 :shifted :durations [2 1 3])])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

The =:euclidean= flag let you generate euclidean rythmns: https://blog.landr.com/euclidean-rhythms/

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description "~trésillo"}
 (chans
  (patch :tinkle-bell)
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 8 3 :euclidean)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description "~bembé"}
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- _)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 12 7 :euclidean)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description "~bossa"}
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) (tup o1- _)]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/gen-tup 16 5 :euclidean)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

2 more examples:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(let
 [rtup (! (r/gen-tup 16 5 :euclidean :shifted))]
 (play
  (patch :tinkle-bell)
  (chans (ntup 2 o1-) rtup [o1 rtup] [o2 rtup] [o3 rtup])
  (dup 4)
  (adjust {:duration 8})))
#+end_src

Fancy variation:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(let
 [rtup
  (!
   [(r/gen-tup 16 5 :euclidean :shifted)
    (each [(maybe o1 o2) (one-of vel4 vel6 vel8)])])]
 (play
  mixolydian
  (patch :vibraphone)
  (lin same (transpose c4-))
  (h/align-contexts)
  (each
   (chans
    [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
    [(patch :acoustic-bass) t1- (tup same s1-)]
    rtup
    [d4 rtup]
    [d6 rtup]
    [d10 rtup]))
  (dup 8)
  (adjust {:duration 32})))
#+end_src

**** Transformation

Once we have written or generated a rythmn we may want to make it evolve, here is some functions that can help.

***** noon.lib.melody

We can use the previously seen functions from =noon.lib.melody= to permute or rotate a rythmn.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1- (tup same [vel5 o1]) (dup 8)]
  [(patch :woodblock)
   (r/gen-tup 12 5 :euclidean)
   (rep 8 (probs {(m/permutation :rand) 1, (m/rotation :rand) 3}))]))
#+end_src

***** r/rotation

Unlike =noon.lib.melody/rotation= this function do not operates on a note basis

****** Example

Rotating a score by the given duration

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1- (dup 4)]
  [(patch :woodblock)
   (r/durtup 2 1 1 4)
   (lin _ (r/rotation 1/2) (r/rotation 1/4) (r/rotation -1/4))]))
#+end_src

You can rotate by any duration, even if it do not really make sense.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (r/rotation -1/5)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

You can also rotate relatively to score duration. Here we are starting with a score of duration 2. With the form (r/rotation :relative -1/4) we are rotating it a quarter of its duration backward.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (r/rotation :relative -1/4)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

There is also forms to randomly pick a rotation (rotation :rand-by <increment>) : pick a random rotation using increment as resolution. (rotation :rand-sub <n>) : split the score in 'n parts and rotate to a randomly picked one.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (r/rotation :rand-by 1/2)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (r/rotation :rand-sub 4)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

***** r/permutation

Like =noon.lib.rythmn/rotation=, =noon.lib.rythmn/permutation= do not operate on a note basis like =noon.lib.melody/permutation=. It operates on even time splits

****** Example

Let's start with this tup:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (dup 4))
#+end_src

Here we are picking a random permutation of our score splitted in 4 equal parts.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (chans
  [(patch :tinkle-bell) o1-]
  [(patch :woodblock) (r/durtup 2 1 1 4) (r/permutation 4)])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

Like we've seen with =noon.lib.melody/permutation=, there is several way to choose a particular permutation. With the second argument we can specify how to pick one.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(r/permutation 4 1) ; picking the most similar base 4 permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(r/permutation 4 -1) ; picking the least similar base 4 permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(r/permutation 8 [0 1/2]) ; picking one of the most similar base 8 permutation
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(r/permutation 8 :rand) ; picking a random base 8 permutation
#+end_src

fun:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description "rythmic permutation demo"}
 (chans
  [(patch :taiko-drum) vel5 (dup 4)]
  [(patch :woodblock)
   (r/durtup 2 1 1 1/2 1/2)
   (each (maybe o1 o1-))
   (nlin 4 (r/permutation 5))]
  [(patch :electric-piano-1)
   o1-
   vel4
   lydian
   (par> d0 d3 d3 d3 d3)
   (lin (root :C) (root :Eb) (root :Ab) (root :Db))])
 (dup 4))
#+end_src

*** Harmony

Within the lib.harmony module you will find some tools to deal with chords.

**** Voicings

In musical terms, a voicing is a particular agencement of a chord. When we speak of a chord like for instance G7, we are not specifying the precise way we will dispose its components.

It can be played in closed position

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :electric-piano-1) V tetrad (par s0 s1 s2 s3))
#+end_src

Inverted (first inversion)

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :electric-piano-1) V tetrad (par [o1 s0] s1 s2 s3))
#+end_src

Or dropped (drop 2)

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :electric-piano-1) V tetrad (par s1 [o1 s2] s3 s4))
#+end_src

and many other ways...

***** Inversions

upward inversions

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) (par s0 s1 s2) (rep 4 (h/inversion 1)))
#+end_src

downward double inversions

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) o1 (par s0 s1 s2) (rep 4 (h/inversion -2)))
#+end_src

In those particular exemples we could have done the same using s1 and s2-, here the equivalent of the first example:

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) (par s0 s1 s2) (rep 4 s1))
#+end_src

But it is not always the case with more complex chords

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 {:description "4 successive double inversions upward on a Cmaj79 "}
 (patch :vibraphone)
 o1-
 (par d0 d2 d4 d6 d8)
 (rep 4 (h/inversion 2)))
#+end_src

***** Drops

A drop is voicing where some notes have been sent into upper octaves.

Here some common drops:

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(let
 [closed
  (par s0 s1 s2 s3)
  drop2
  (par s0 [o1 s1] s2 s3)
  drop3
  (par s0 s1 [o1 s2] s3)
  drop23
  (par s0 [o1 s1] [o1 s2] s3)]
 (play
  (patch :vibraphone)
  tetrad
  (lin closed drop2 drop3 drop23)
  (each dur:2)))
#+end_src

****** drop

This function help you to drop a voicing. It takes the same polymorphic kind of argument (called a 'member-pick') that we've seen with =noon.lib.melody/permutation= and =noon.lib.melody/rotation=.

******* Examples

pick a random drop of Cmaj7

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) tetrad (par s0 s1 s2 s3) (h/drop :rand))
#+end_src

first drop

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) tetrad (par s0 s1 s2 s3) (h/drop 1))
#+end_src

last drop

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) tetrad (par s0 s1 s2 s3) (h/drop -1))
#+end_src

one-of the least wide drop

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play (patch :vibraphone) tetrad (par s0 s1 s2 s3) (h/drop [0 1/2]))
#+end_src

**** Chord progressions

A chord progression is simply a succession of different chords, cyclic or not.

***** Voice leading

When dealing with chord progression one of the first thing to consider is called voice leading, it is the way voicings succession is handled.

Let's start with a very common chord progression.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :electric-piano-1)
 (lin I VI IV V)
 (each (par s0 s1 s2))
 (dup 2))
#+end_src

It do not sound bad but it can arguably be better.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :electric-piano-1)
 (lin I VI II V)
 (each [(par s0 s1 s2) (h/drop -1)])
 h/voice-led
 (dup 2))
#+end_src

The =voice-led= transformation is using inversions and drops in order to minimize voices motion between successive chords.

It is a really smooth way to transition between voicings but it would be nice to get the original bass motion back.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (lin I VI II V)
 (chans
  [(patch :acoustic-bass) C-2 (each t-round)]
  [(patch :electric-piano-1) (each (par s0 s1 s2)) h/voice-led])
 (dup 2))
#+end_src

It works on any voicings.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (structure :tetrad)
 (lin I VI II V)
 (chans
  [(patch :acoustic-bass) C-2 (each [t-round (tup _ s2-)])]
  [(patch :electric-piano-1)
   (each [(par s0 s1 s2 s3) (h/inversion -3) (h/drop 1/2)])
   h/voice-led])
 (dup 2))
#+end_src

The voice-led function is quite resource consuming and remain to be optimized...

***** Melodies

Once you have a chord progression, you may want to apply a melody on it.

One way to do so is to use the =noon.lib.harmony/align-contexts= transformation

****** align-contexts

Let's start with a simple chord progression in minor.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :clarinet)
 (scale :harmonic-minor)
 (lin I IV VII I)
 (each (tup s0 s1 s2)))
#+end_src

the tup is applied on each chord without any inversion.

With =noon.lib.harmony/align-contexts= we can connect contexts together with minimal offsets, resulting in more conjoint motions.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 (patch :clarinet)
 (scale :harmonic-minor)
 (lin I IV VII I)
 (h/align-contexts :s)
 (each (tup s0 s1 s2)))
#+end_src

The word 'context' may seem a bit confusing, what it really stands for is 'harmonic context', the harmonic context can be found under the =:pitch= key of any event.

A more elaborated example

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
 dur2
 (scale :harmonic-minor)
 (lin I IV VII I)
 (h/align-contexts :s)
 (lin same (transpose c3) same)
 (chans
  [(patch :choir-aahs)
   vel4
   (each [(par s0 s1 s2) (maybe (tup s0 s1-) (tup s0 s1))])]
  [(patch :ocarina)
   vel6
   (each
    [(shuftup s0 s1 s2)
     (each
      (one-of
       (tup s0 (shuflin (one-of c1- s-) s+) s0)
       (tup s0 c1- s0 (one-of s2- s2))))])]
  [(patch :acoustic-bass) vel3 o2-]))
#+end_src

****** harmonic-zip

This transformation helps you to zip a melody on a chord progression. This way you don't have to worry at all about the chords, just write a melody it will be adjusted to chord changes.

Let's first write a simple melodic pattern.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(play
 (patch :ocarina)
 (tup s0 s1 [s2 (lin d1 d1- _)] s1)
 (dupt 4)
 (adjust {:duration 4}))
#+end_src

Now let's use the =h/harmonic-zip= function to apply this to a chord progression.

#+begin_src clojure :pp
(play
  (h/harmonic-zip
   [(scale :harmonic-minor) (tup I IV VII I) (h/align-contexts :s)]
   [(patch :ocarina) (tup s0 s1 [s2 (lin d1 d1- _)] s1) (dupt 4)])
 (dup 2)
 (adjust {:duration 6}))
#+end_src

Almost the same with comping.

#+begin_src clojure :proll
(play
  (h/harmonic-zip
   [(scale :harmonic-minor) (tup I IV VII I) (h/align-contexts :s)]
   (chans
    [(patch :ocarina)
     (tup s0 s1 [s2 (lin d1 d1- _)] s1)
     (dupt 4)]
    [(patch :acoustic-bass) t2-]
    [(patch :choir-aahs) vel4 (par s0 s2 s4)]))
  (dup 2)
  (adjust {:duration 12}))
#+end_src
